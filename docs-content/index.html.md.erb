This documentation describes Zettaset XCrypt Full Disk for Pivotal Data Suite (PDS). Zettaset XCrypt Full Disk for PDS enables disk-level encryption for all nodes in your deployment of Pivotal Greenplum and Pivotal GemFire. Developers can encrypt entire disks or specific partitions, extend encryption to new nodes, rotate keys, and remove encryption as needed. 

Zettaset's Virtual Enterprise Key Manager (V-EKM) and Virtual Hardware Security Module (V-HSM) are available, separately, as scalable, software-based key management and HSM solutions that are fully integrated with XCrypt Full Disk.
